                    was during my senior year in high school. I had a friend who was into games who made his own game. My curiousity instantly peaked.
                    I wanted to see how exactly he made it, and he showed me some of the code he had written. Right then and there I decided to laearn more about it.
                    However, I went into my Freshman year in college still Undecided as I was afraid of taking that leap. I finally decided to take that leap
                    the year after and it has been a wonderful ride to say the least.
